### Phase 1
The idea is to use scrap the quotes from various websites ([BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com/),[quoteload](https://www.quoteload.com/)). We will use [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for this.<br />
To get started with this you can watch a small tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k).<br />
Functionalities to be supported are:
* Get quotes from particular topic, categories. (love, classics, passion)
* Get quotes from particular person. (George Orwell, Stephen King, J.K Rowling, etc)

### Phase 2

We will convert this into a pip package. Read more about `pip` [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp).

Use what we have built till now to make a twitter bot which will tweet quotes everyday.
